# Tailored directly to fit your vision!

The MVP Studio process is unique and based on agile development. This process is split into phases:

**_Proposal and project goals:_**

- Is the problem understood?
- Is there an MVP that can be delivered within 3 months?
- Are there key stakeholders involved throughout the process?
- Is there a support plan?
- What is the budget?

**_Development:_**

- Discovery : steps to understanding the problem
- Prioritization : identify the must-haves to solve the problem
- Wire-framing : priorities are defined and a mock-up begins of application
- Development : developers begin building the vision

**_Hand-off_**:

- The sprints have ended and there is a working application that showcases your vision

**_Support (there are two options)_**

- Visionary has outside support in place
- MVP standard support contract
