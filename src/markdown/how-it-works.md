# Tailored directly to fit your vision!

The MVP Studio process is unique and based on agile development. This process is split into phases:  

***Proposal and project goals:***  
    - Is the problem understood?  
    - Is there an MVP that can be delivered within 3 months?  
    - Are there key stakeholders involved throughout the process?  
    - Is there a support plan?  
    - What is the budget?  

***Development:***  
    - Discovery : steps to understanding the problem  
    - Prioritization : identify the must-haves to solve the problem  
    - Wire-framing : priorities are defined and a mock-up begins of application  
    - Development : developers begin building the vision  

***Hand-off***:   
     - The sprints have ended and there is a working application that showcases your vision  
 
 ***Support(there are two options)***  
	 - Customer has outside support in place  
	 - MVP standard support contract
